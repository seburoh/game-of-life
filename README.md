# Game Of Life
Simple implementation of John Conway's *Game of Life* using javascript. Can be directly run on the associated github.io page.

# Interaction
There are three sliders which control various aspects of the simulation:
* Speed: The speed of the simulation from slow to fast. If the slider is moved all the way to the left, the simulation pauses.
* Cell Size: The size of each cell in the simulation. To apply this change the restart button must be pressed.
* Life Chance: The chance for each cell to be alive at the start of the simulation. To apply this change the restart button must be pressed.
* Use image: Replaces the green squares that represent life with a small image. Not as readable, here for experimentation with loading images into the canvas.
* restart: Restarts simulation, required for changes in Cell Size or Life Chance.

# Drawbacks
The HTML is fairly crude. May revisit in the future to improve the appearance of the elements.
